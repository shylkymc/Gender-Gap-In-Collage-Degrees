# Gender-Gap-In-Collage-Degrees

In this project, I used a data set which is created to show the percentage of women who graduate with bachelor degrees. My purpose is to visualize the situation of women's education.The data set has 17 columns. These columns show the fields and the percentages of graduated women for every year. It starts with the year 1970 and finishes with the year 2011. 
I used Pandas to open data. I seperated fields according to their profession. I didn't need to clean this data set, because it was cleaned already. I used matplotlib to visualize the data. After that I developed my graphics. Finally, I wrote a code to save the graphic as a photo. You can find the last version of the graphic [here](https://github.com/shylkymc/Gender-Gap-In-Collage-Degrees/blob/master/gender_degrees.png).
